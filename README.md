## Purpose and Design

This web application simulates an educational experience for learning high quality chess openings. 
Users accessing the application can register an account with a username and corresponding password before loggin in.

The applcation consists of several portals, namely a:

- Homepage
- Learn Portal
- Test Portal
- Results Portal
- Feedback Portal

A typical user experience involves the following steps:

1. Using the learning tools to become familiar with and master a number of iconic chess openings. The learning experience is unlimited and can be completed as many times as wanted.
2. Completing a formative assessment for each opening whereby users are required to apply their learning in an environment without teaching support.
3. Accessing results to track learning progess. 
4. Accessing feedback to gain meaningful insights into test performance.

## Development

The chess-openings web application was developed according to an *agile* software development framework. 

This involved the following phases which were carried out in a cyclical manner:

1. Brainstorming the high-level view for the application design.
2. Developing many user stories that describe the features of the application. These stories are then broken down into tasks for each sprint.
3. Estimating time and resources required for each story. Allocating team members to different features for each sprint.
4. Consolidating user stories and refactoring code.
5. Designing and executing unit tests at the end of each sprint.
